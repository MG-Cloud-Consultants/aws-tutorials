aws-tutorials
==============================
I'm trying to publish some examples from my daily work with AWS here.

This is a list of the articles:
* [Accessing RDS MySQL with Spring Cloud AWS and IAM Roles](https://masteringaws.blogspot.com/2018/11/accessing-rds-mysql-with-spring-cloud.html)
* [Deploying Vendor-Agnostic Serverless Functions on AWS](https://masteringaws.blogspot.com/2019/01/spring-cloud-function-aws.html)
* [Deploying Deploying Spring Cloud Functions as Spring Boot App](https://masteringaws.blogspot.com/2019/02/spring-cloud-functions-spring-boot.html)

All code examples are - unless otherwise stated - published under the MIT license
